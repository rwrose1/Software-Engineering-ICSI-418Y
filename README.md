# Overview

The semester project for ICSI-418 consists of a base level of required functionality that can be implemented using one of several development platforms.  There is one platform that is required for implementation that one team will be responsible for.  More on the platforms below.  This project will be the final for the course and must be complete by the date indicated above.

# Required Functionality

The required functionality consists of a web scraping function, user interface, search, business logic and a database.  The user interface must be developed so that the user can enter search parameters and click a button that will retrieve the search data from the database and produce a page with the results.  Each of the data entry fields on the user interface must be searchable on the database.  The user should be required to log on to the application with a user id and password.  

As a search is executed and multiple results are found, the user interface must allow the user to scroll through the search results.  The user interface will need to allow the data from the screen to be printed to PDF.

The application also needs to be able to export the data that was retrieved to a CSV file.  Prompt the user for the location and name of the export file.

# Platforms

TBD. 

# Data Content

https://www.nasdaq.com/options/

The application will need to follow links on the page and web screen scrape content from the page and place the data into the database.  The scrape will be of the headline, the symbols in the headline and the associated text for each of the symbols in the headline.  This data will be stored to the database along with the date of the scrape.the page and place the data into the datatabase.

# Search Data UI

The user will be able to search each of the data elements via a search page and a results page will be displayed showing all of the data in the row.  The search page should have a submit button, reset button and exit button that will log the user off the application.
